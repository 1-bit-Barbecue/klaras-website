# The Pen may be mightier than the Sword… but what happens when you master both?

…Okay, that part about mastering the sword may be a wee bit of an exaggeration. I do love sword fighting, but I’ve never been that good at it. What I am good at, is finding intersections between literature and other artforms, between language and our senses, between words and experiences. The results of these collisions can be found in my portfolio: works of double-edged poetry, dialogues that taste good in your mouth when you read them aloud, and stories that melt seamlessly into music and images.

In the beginning there was the Word - but that was the first and last time it existed in total vacuum.
